#Setup process

-   Added a new configuration to my installed Homestead vagrant machine.

-   Cloned the repo from laravel for fresh install

-   Deleted the old Homestead because I didn’t use it in a while and it didn’t work with the new laravel

-   Setup everything

-   Changed caching and session to be stored in redis and installed redis

-   Updated the permissions and ownership on storage and bootstrap/cache

-   Installed bladewind to make it pretty
